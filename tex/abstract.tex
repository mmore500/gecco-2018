\section{Abstract} \label{sec:abstract}

Two schemes for automatic generation of evolvable genotype-phenotype mappings are presented.
Both schemes use an artificial neural network (ANN) autoencoder trained on phenotypes harvested from fitness peaks as the basis for a genotype-phenotype mapping.
In the first, the decoder segment of a bottlenecked autoencoder is used as the genotype-phenotype mapping.
In the second, a denoising autoencoder is used as the genotype-phenotype mapping.
Both schemes are demonstrated on the $n$-legged table problem, a toy problem that defines a simple rugged fitness landscape.
These schemes are both found to enhance evolvability in the $n$-legged table domain relative to the direct encoding.
