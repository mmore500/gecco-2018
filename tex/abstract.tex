We present AutoMap, a pair of methods for automatic generation of evolvable genotype-phenotype mappings.
Both use an artificial neural network autoencoder trained on phenotypes harvested from fitness peaks as the basis for a genotype-phenotype mapping.
In the first, the decoder segment of a bottlenecked autoencoder serves as the genotype-phenotype mapping.
In the second, a denoising autoencoder serves as the genotype-phenotype mapping.
Automatic generation of evolvable genotype-phenotype mappings are demonstrated on the $n$-legged table problem, a toy problem that defines a simple rugged fitness landscape, and the Scrabble string problem, a more complicated problem that serves as a rough model for linear genetic programming.
For both problems, the automatically generated genotype-phenotype mappings are found to enhance evolvability.
