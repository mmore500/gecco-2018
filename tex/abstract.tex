\section{Abstract} \label{sec:abstract}

The goal of this project is to develop methodology to generate highly evolvable representations for evolutionary computing.
Specifically, this project sets out to investigate the feasibility of co-evolving a representation and a solution, where the representation will be selected for based on evolvability metrics and the solution will be selected for fitness.
The approach will be tested with the $n$ legs problem, a toy problem where the objective is to evolve a set of leg lengths for a table.
