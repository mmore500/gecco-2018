\section{Expected Results}

Two types of evolutionary trials will be assessed: control and experimental regimes.
Under both the control and experimental regimes, solution genotypes will represented as a $n$-length bitstring.
Under the control regime, the identity genotype-phenotype mapping will be employed.
Under the experimental regime, the co-evolving solution-mapping algorithm described in Section \ref{sec:approach} will be employed.

The ability of the algorithm to discover low cost solutions to the $n$ legs problem (i.e. overcoming the deceptive nature of the search space) will be assessed.
The ability of the algorithm to yield an evolvable mapping will also be assessed by measuring the evolvability signature of mappings present at the end of evolutionary runs \cite{tarapore2015evolvability}.
The performance of the algorithm on these two metrics will be calculated over a range of $n$ and $\alpha$ values.

It is hoped that the proposed algorithm will discover better solutions to the $n$ leg problem and will yield more evolvable representations than the control scheme, particularly for large $n$.
