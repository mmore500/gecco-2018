\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

Indirect encodings are known to be able to take advantage of regularities of an evolutionary search space to facilitate successful evolutionary search by biasing search towards viable and allowing large steps in the phenotype space to be made quickly \cite{clune2009evolving}.
Through generative encodings such as Hyper-NEAT, evolutionary computing researchers have attempted to achieve evolvable genotype-phenotype mapping through direct selection in the genotype space \cite{mengistu2016evolvability}.
This project, which will investigate selection for an evolvable genotype-phenotype mapping explicitly separate from selection in the genotype space of a problem, is a natural extension of existing interest in achieving evolvable genotype-phenotype mappings through generative encodings.
It is hoped that this project will yield useful evolutionary computing methodology to achieve highly evolvable genotype-phenotype mappings.
