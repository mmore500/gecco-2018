\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

Indirect genotype-phenotype maps are known to be able to take advantage of regularities of an evolutionary search space to facilitate successful evolutionary search by biasing search towards viable outcomes and allowing large steps in the phenotype space to be made quickly \cite{clune2009evolving}.
Such genotype-phenotype maps that facilitate evolutionary search are described as ``evolvable.''
Through generative encodings such as Hyper-NEAT, evolutionary computing researchers have attempted to achieve evolvable genotype-phenotype mapping through direct selection in the genotype space \cite{mengistu2016evolvability}.
These approaches are akin to the biological realm, where embryological development is genetically-encoded.
This paper proposes a different take on automatic generation of evolvable genotype-phenotype mapping by proposing two techniques to directly learn evolvable genotype-phenotype mappings through artificial neural network autoencoders.
It is hoped that this project will yield useful evolutionary computing methodology to achieve automatic design of highly evolvable genotype-phenotype mappings.
